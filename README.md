# react-portfolio

## Description
The 20th challenge of the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp was creating a single-paged portfolio website utilizing React. To do this, I created a navigation-bar component that will render on every page; letting you to select a tab for the page you're wanting to visit. To keep track of the current page that is supposed to be open, I employed a state variable named "currentPage" in the PortfolioContainer component in order to render the necessary page/component when the state variable is updated. Lastly, the footer also renders on every page that contains links to my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts.
